# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

Module 20 Challenge-Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is to help a data scientist and programer, Beks with making a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be sucessful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 


## Results:


## Summary: 

The deep learning neural network model did not reach the target of 75% accuracy, which we could say that the model is not outperforming. 

I would recommend using a different model to solve the classification problem, and justification would be to use Random Forest Classifier to combine multiple decision trees and generate a classified output to therefore evaluate performance.
